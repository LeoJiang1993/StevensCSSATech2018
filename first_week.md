# First Week Challenge
Hi, all:

On behave of Stevens CSSA Tech Department, I would like to extend a warm welcome to all of you.

To Back End Developers (a.k.a Python):

This is the first challenge for all of you. 
Many of you may have strong experience in programming or some of you even have no idea with a program.
This guild line can help you check if you understand the basic features of Python.
We will have a quick test focus on these features and the result for the whole test will be at most 100 lines
(I will do it before I assign it to you.). I hope it will not cost you a lot of time. 
The test will be given out on friday and you are expected to submit it on Saturday.

To Front End Developers and those who want to do PS:

Guys who wants to join the front end group can contact me and we may have a discussion on what to do. 
Since currently the frount end and back end are running on the same server, 
I'm considering making them seperate with Vue or AngulaJS.

Hopefully, the project is expected to be arranged with agile method, dividing by scrum. Hopefully...

Thank you for your cooperation. If you have any technical concerns on the following things, pls DO NOT hesitate asking me.


Best Regards,

Stevens CSSA Tech Department
