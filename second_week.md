# Second Week

Before I add you guys into the project, you still have something you
should know and you have to sign a contract shows that you will not share
our codes with anyone else other than group members.

* How post transfer information?

# MVC structure
You may take a general look at django framework docs. Search the Internet
and try to figure out what is MVC.

However, MVC is not a strong rules for your codes, it does help arrange
our codes and make them easier for maintenance.
